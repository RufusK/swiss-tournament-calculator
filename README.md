# Swiss Tournament Calculator

## Description
This is a free open-source typescript library for calculating FIDE conform Dutch Swiss tournament pairings.

It is usable in the browser, Node.js and bun.

It makes use of the [bbpPairings](https://github.com/BieremaBoyzProgramming/bbpPairings) algorithm (for rounds > 1), which was originally written in C++ and has been ported to WebAssembly.

Feel free to contribute to the project by opening issues or submitting pull requests.
